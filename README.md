NCPP
====

The National Climate Predictions and Projections (NCPP) Platform develops comprehensive regional and local information about the evolving climate to inform decision making and adaptation planning. Within NCPP, users and scientists collaboratively generate, review, and analyze climate predictions and projections. NCPP is built on three pillars:

Facilitate the development of application-oriented communities of contributors of scientific knowledge and expertise, and the practitioners who make it useful in decision making or management processes.

Become an authoritative source for practices and standards, recommendations and guidance related to the downscaling of climate data and the implementation and interpretation of that data in climate change impacts and risk assessment studies.

Develop a flexible and extensible evaluation platform that offers important performance metrics on methods, data and tools.

NCPP recognizes the abundance of existing, distributed capabilities that need to be brought together in an open-source and open-innovation environment to address the complex challenges of climate change.
