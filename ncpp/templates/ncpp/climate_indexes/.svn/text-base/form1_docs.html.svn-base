			<td>A future world of very rapid economic growth, low population growth and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technology. 
			    Major underlying themes are economic and cultural convergence and capacity building, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income.

			<td>A very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is that of strengthening regional cultural identities, with an emphasis on family values 
			    and local traditions, high population growth, and less concern for rapid economic development.

			<th nowrap="nowrap"><a href="http://www.ipcc-data.org/sres/ddc_sres_emissions.html#b2">SRES B2</a></th>
			<td>A world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability. It is again a heterogeneous world with less rapid, 
			    and more diverse technological change but a strong emphasis on community initiative and social innovation to find local, rather than global solutions.
